# Healthmaster
## Inspiration
During the COVID-19 crisis, I have been battling with my own mental health alongside many of my friends and loved ones. My inspiration comes from a combination of my own experiences and a previous project I worked on for my SQL class in Fall 2019, which is the basic framework for this larger work.

## What it does
How do you manage your mental health when it feels like your world is crashing and burning? By regulating your exposure to social media, checking in with your current mood, and tracking self-care. Healthmaster is currently being programmed as an Android app, but ideally would also be an iOS app as well as Chrome and Firefox extensions for maximum cross-platform capability.

The first feature of Healthmaster will allow users to keep track of their mental and/or physical health for self-evaluation and improvement in self-care trends. Additionally it will allow users to enter symptoms which will be checked against a database of diagnoses (including but not limited to COVID-19), and will recommend user actions based on these diagnoses. Example: if a user's symptoms match a majority of COVID-19 symptoms, the app would recommend that they self-isolate and call their doctor to see if they can get tested for the disease. This feature is also useful once the COVID-19 crisis has passed, since it can sometimes be difficult to evaluate one's mental and physical health when suffering from depression, anxiety, and other mental health conditions.

The second feature of Healthmaster will allow users to monitor and limit their social media consumption. Negative electronic engagement has been a problem for years, but it's become exacerbated during the COVID-19 crisis.
